        "description": "The first step in the acrylic application process is preparing the natural nails. This involves removing any existing nail polish, trimming and filing the nails, and pushing back the cuticles. The nails are then buffed to remove the natural shine, which allows the acrylic material to better adhere to the nails.",

Additionally, after the acrylic application and shaping, a topcoat or sealant is usually applied to restore shine and protect the acrylic nails. Proper nail preparation is a key step in the overall process, ensuring the best results for both the appearance and durability of the acrylic nail art.",
